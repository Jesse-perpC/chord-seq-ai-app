# Chord progressions

Chord progressions are the backbone of harmony in music. They are a series of chords played or sung in a specific order to create a sense of movement and direction in a piece of music. Although each chord may be associated with a specific mood, they can be used in various ways to create different emotional effects in music. Chords gain their true meaning and function when they are used in the context of a chord progression.

## What are chord progressions?

A chord progression is a series of chords played in sequence. Each chord in a progression has a specific function and relationship to the other chords in the sequence. Chord progressions are typically used to create tension and release, establish a tonal center, and guide the listener through different sections of a piece of music.

The concept of tonality refers to the relationship between chords and the key of a piece of music. This concept gives rise to the notion of diatonic chords, which are chords that belong to a specific key and are derived from the notes of the corresponding scale. We usually use Roman numerals to represent diatonic chords, with uppercase numerals indicating major chords and lowercase numerals indicating minor chords.

For example, in the key of C major, the diatonic chords are as follows: I (C major), ii (D minor), iii (E minor), IV (F major), V (G major), vi (A minor), and viiÂ° (B diminished). These chords can be combined in various ways to create different chord progressions that evoke different emotions and moods.

The simplest look at chord progressions is through the lens of functional harmony, which categorizes chords into three main functions: tonic (I), dominant (V), and subdominant (IV). The tonic function is the most stable and provides a sense of resolution, while the dominant function creates tension and leads to resolution. The subdominant function is a transitional function that connects the tonic and dominant functions.

## Examples of chord progressions

Given functional harmony, we can already see some common chord progressions that are used in various styles of music. For example, I-IV-V-I creates a sense of resolution and stability. It is commonly used to establish the tonal center of a piece and create a sense of closure.

When we want to get into slightly more complex territory, we can create chord progressions just with the diatonic chords. The most common 4-chord progression is I-V-vi-IV, which is used in countless pop and rock songs and has a catchy and uplifting sound.

Working with larger progressions can benefit from the analysis of individual functions. Candence is a sequence of chords that creates a sense of resolution or finality. The most common cadence is the authentic cadence (V-I), which creates a strong sense of resolution and closure. By extending the authentic cadence with another pre-dominant chord, we can create the famous ii-V-I progression that is used in Jazz and other styles of music.

## Advanced chord progressions

The circle of fifths is another powerful tool at your disposal, which is a sequence of chords that move in fifths. You can start with C major, move all the tones in perfect fifths, and you will end up with G major, D major, A major, and so on, eventually returning back to C major. Chords that are close to each other in the circle of fifths have a strong harmonic relationship and can be used to create smooth and natural-sounding progressions.

You may also want to experiment with modal interchange, which involves borrowing chords from parallel keys or modes to create more colorful and harmonically rich progressions. For example, you can use chords from the parallel minor key in a major key progression to create a darker and more emotional sound.

However, when you want to delve into complex and sophisticated progressions, introducing non-diatonic chords, upper chord extensions, and other alterations, the space of possibilities becomes vast and hard to navigate. This is where ChordSeqAI can help you explore new ideas, experiment with different chord progressions, and learn more about music theory. By suggesting the next chord in a progression, ChordSeqAI can guide you through the process of creating harmonically rich and emotionally engaging music.
