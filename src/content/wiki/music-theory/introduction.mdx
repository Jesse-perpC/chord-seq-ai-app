## What is music theory?

Music theory is the study of the principles and elements that govern music. It is not a set of rules that must be followed but rather a framework that helps musicians understand how music works. Music theory provides a common language and vocabulary for musicians to communicate and collaborate effectively.

Music theory encompasses a wide range of topics, including music notation, general principles and structures, composition, evolution of music, and more. It helps musicians analyze and interpret music, compose new pieces, and understand the historical context of different musical styles.
