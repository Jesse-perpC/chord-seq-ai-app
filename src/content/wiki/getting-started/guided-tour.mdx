# Guided Tour

This guided tour will help you get started with the ChordSeqAI app. You will learn how to use the app to compose chord progressions with AI. This is an alternative to the built-in guided tour, feel free to use the one you prefer.

## Add a blank chord

Click on the plus icon <InlineIcon src="/plus.svg" size="s" /> (alternatively shortcut `A`) at the top of the timeline to add a new chord. It will be initialized as an empty chord, denoted by `?`.

## Wait for the AI to load

After selecting the first chord, the AI model will start loading. It may take a while for the first time as the model is downloading, but it should be pretty quick after that.

## Repeat the process

Continue adding and selecting chords to build your chord progression. The AI will suggest chords that fit well together.

## Specify the genre and decade (optional)

ChordSeqAI allows you to specify the style used for chord suggestions. Click on the right part of the split button above the timeline to select the genre and decade.
