# Privacy

ChordSeqAI is committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data responsibly. This page outlines how your data is processed by the ChordSeqAI web app.

## Data collection

We use [Umami Analytics](https://umami.is/), focusing on privacy and anonymity. We collect minimal, anonymized data solely to enhance app functionality and user experience. No personal or detailed usage data is tracked. Umami is [GDPR-compliant and does not use cookies](https://umami.is/docs#frequently-asked-questions).

If you still want to opt out of analytics, you can disable them by running `localStorage.​setItem('umami.​disabled', 1)` in the browser console.

## Data storage

ChordSeqAI stores all data, including but not limited to chord progressions, settings, and user preferences, locally in your browser. No data is stored on our servers or shared with third parties. You can clear your data at any time by clearing your browser cache for the ChordSeqAI app.
