# Web Stack

ChordSeqAI was built using Next.js 14 with TypeScript (with the new App Router), Tailwind CSS, and various libraries. Zustand is used for state management, ONNX Runtime for inference, and Tone.js for audio playback. Some animations are done with Framer Motion, MidiWriterJS is used for MIDI file generation, React Virtualized serves to optimize the suggestions list, and Umami Analytics is employed for basic usage statistics.

It is a progressive web app (PWA) that can be installed on your device. The app is hosted on GitHub Pages and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/PetrIvan/chord-seq-ai-app).
