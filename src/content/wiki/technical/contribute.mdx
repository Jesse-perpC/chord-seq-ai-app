# Contribute

ChordSeqAI is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. If you have a technical background and are interested in helping improve the app, you can contribute to the codebase on GitHub. This page provides an overview of what you need to know to get started with contributing to ChordSeqAI.

## Getting started

Before you start contributing to ChordSeqAI, make sure you are familiar with the [technologies](/wiki/technical/web-stack) used in the project, its [architecture](/wiki/technical/architecture), and the app itself. Start by forking the [ChordSeqAI repository](https://github.com/PetrIvan/chord-seq-ai-app) on GitHub and cloning it to your local machine. You can then set up the development environment and run the app locally to get a feel for how it works.

## Conventions

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to enforce code style and formatting conventions in the ChordSeqAI codebase. Make sure to run these tools before submitting a pull request to ensure your changes adhere to the project's coding standards.

## How to contribute

Here are the general steps to follow when contributing to ChordSeqAI:

- **Find an issue or feature request**: Before making changes, check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/PetrIvan/chord-seq-ai-app/issues) and [feature requests](https://github.com/PetrIvan/chord-seq-ai-app/discussions/categories/feature-requests?discussions_q=category%3A%22Feature+requests%22+is%3Aopen) to see if there is an existing issue or feature request that you can work on. If not, feel free to create a new issue or feature request to discuss your proposed changes.
- **Fork the repository**: Before making any changes, fork the ChordSeqAI repository on GitHub.
- **Create a new branch**: Create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the changes. We use the format `feature/your-feature-name` for feature branches and `bug/your-fix-name` for bug-fix branches.
- **Make your changes**: Modify the codebase. Follow the coding style and conventions used in the project. Make sure to test your changes locally before submitting a pull request.
- **Commit and push your changes**: Commit your changes with a descriptive message. Push your changes to your forked repository.
- **Submit a pull request**: Once you are ready, submit a pull request to the main ChordSeqAI repository. Provide a detailed description of the changes you made and why they are necessary. Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers, and you may be asked to make further changes before it is merged.
