# Support Us

ChordSeqAI is a free and open-source project developed by a solo developer. Since we don't run ads or charge for the app, we rely on the support of our users to help cover the costs of development, maintenance, and hosting. If you enjoy using ChordSeqAI and would like to support its continued development, there are several ways you can help.

## Spread the word

One of the best ways to support ChordSeqAI is by spreading the word and sharing the app with others. Tell your friends, family, and fellow musicians about ChordSeqAI and encourage them to give it a try. Sharing the app on social media, forums, and other platforms can help us reach a wider audience and grow the ChordSeqAI community.

## Support us financially

If you would like to support ChordSeqAI financially, you can make a donation to help cover the costs of development and hosting. Your contributions are greatly appreciated and help us continue to improve and expand the app for all users.
