# Overview

Dive deep into the features of the ChordSeqAI app to get the most out of it. This structured description will help you understand the main features of ChordSeqAI and how to use them. Alternatively, you can check out the [usage](/wiki/getting-started/usage) page for a high-level overview without getting into details.

## Shortcuts and autosave

Most interactions in ChordSeqAI support keyboard-only input; to learn the shortcut (hotkey) for some button, hover over it. When describing a feature, the shortcut is usually mentioned in parentheses (e.g., `Ctrl + Z`).

After any modification to the chord progression or settings, the state of the app is saved automatically. It is kept in the browser local storage, it will remain there until you delete the site data. In particular, chords, signature, model and style selection, playback settings, default variants, and some preferences are saved.

## App layout

The ChordSeqAI app is divided into several sections, each with its own purpose. The main sections are:

- [**Timeline**](/wiki/features/timeline): The main area where you compose the chord progression.

The chords are displayed as violet blocks with the chord symbol. The timeline is divided into bars by tick marks. The playhead is at the beginning of the progression, and the playback controls together with timeline controls are visible at the top of the timeline. The left side of the timeline shows the current time signature as 4/4."

## Other elements

Some components are present in the app but are not part of the main layout. These include:

- [**Chord variants**](/wiki/features/chord-variants): Shows the alternative chord voicings and notations for the selected chord.
